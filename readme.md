## Indexes
- Indexes can be created on fields that are frequently queried, such as jurisdiction, date_enacted, date_decided, and tags.

## Security Considerations
- Implement appropriate access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the database.
- Encrypt sensitive data such as user credentials and personal information.

## Conclusion
The Legal Research Repository database provides a structured and efficient way to store and retrieve legal research materials. By organizing data into collections and defining appropriate document structures, the database enables users to easily search for and access relevant legal information.
